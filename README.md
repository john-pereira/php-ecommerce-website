# acbi-assessment-ecommerce
The ACBI College assessment project aims to create a fully functional e-commerce website using a stack of PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 technologies. This e-commerce platform will offer a seamless shopping experience to users.

Key features of the project include user account management, product management, and a shopping cart system. Users will be able to register and log in securely to their accounts. They can also create new accounts if they are first-time users.

For product management, administrators will have the capability to add new products to the website. These products will be stored in a MySQL database, ensuring easy retrieval and management. Users will be able to browse these products, view details, and add them to their shopping cart.
